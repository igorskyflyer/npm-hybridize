# 🧬 Hybridize ⚡

🧬 `Hybridize` is a simple CLI that I use internally as a part of my [🤖 Modern Module 🌠](https://github.com/igorskyflyer/npm-modern-module) project and [🌈 Robby ☄️](https://github.com/igorskyflyer/robby) - another CLI tool, both are used for providing support for hybrid modules (CommonJS + ES modules) until ES modules become a standard. ⚡

<br>

If you find any use for it as a standalone module, feel free to use it. 😄☝

<br>

## Usage

```shell
npm i -D "@igor.dvlpr/hybridize"
```

<br>

Use it in your scripts, as e.g.

```bash
 hybridize --out "./dist/module" --module esm --overwrite
```

<br>

Use

```bash
hybridize --help
```

to get all available options and flags.
